# Animated Spritesheets

Use this skill when a user wants to start from one character reference image, usually a high-resolution `1024x1024` sprite-like image, and end with a usable animated spritesheet plus review artifacts such as contact sheets and GIFs.

Use it for:
- turning one approved reference sprite into directional anchors or action sheets
- salvaging AI-generated sheets whose poses drift outside implied frame cells
- producing review artifacts a game team can actually inspect

Do not use it for:
- hand-authoring final pixel art frame by frame
- tilemaps, environment sheets, or UI icon sets
- strict tiny-pixel workflows where every source pixel must already be exact

Typical inputs:
- `1` approved reference image, often `1024x1024`
- optional sheet guide such as a `512x1280` alternating-pixel contact sheet
- one prompt file describing direction, action, and frame ordering

Typical outputs:
- generated sheet or directional anchor
- recovered component crops
- optional no-background crops
- normalized runtime frames
- labeled contact sheet
- selected-sequence GIF
- chat-visible frame contact sheet preview, shown automatically in the final response

## Philosophy: Treat Spritesheets As Two Problems

Most AI sprite workflows fail because they treat the whole task as “generate some frames”.

In practice, this is **two different problems**:

1. **Generation**: getting the model to produce the right character, direction, and action.
2. **Registration**: turning that output into stable engine-style frames.

The second problem is usually the harder one.

**Before acting, ask**:
- Is the user asking for strict tiny-pixel art, or “high-resolution pixelated” art?
- Is the reference image already the approved in-game identity, or just concept art?
- Is the deliverable a single anchor frame, a full spritesheet, or a finished GIF preview?
- If the model spills across invisible cell boundaries, what is the source of truth: the cells or the full sheet?

**Core principles**:
1. **Identity anchor first**: use the approved in-game sprite when possible, not upstream concept art.
2. **Recover before polishing**: fix missing silhouette and framing before palette or edge cleanup.
3. **One anchor per sequence**: normalize all frames to one shared center/bottom rule unless the source genuinely requires otherwise.
4. **Review artifacts matter**: contact sheets and GIFs are part of the pipeline, not optional extras.
5. **Prove variants before shipping them**: alternate sheets, mirrored versions, and palette variants are separate animations until their visible center and baseline match the primary strip frame by frame.

## Workflow

### 1. Choose the right input reference

Prefer:
- a single approved sprite-like reference, often `1024x1024`
- one clear identity image, not multiple conflicting art sources

Use concept art only when no approved gameplay-facing sprite exists.

### 2. Create a sheet guide

For multi-frame generation, create a sheet-sized guide image first.

Use `scripts/make_alternating_sheet.py` for:
- a neutral alternating-pixel background
- arbitrary sizes such as `512x1280`
- a guide that pushes pixel texture without adding visible grid lines

This guide is a **style/composition hint**, not a guarantee that the model will obey strict frame cells.

### 2b. Use neutral plates for video-derived walk cycles

When using image-to-video models to create walk-cycle source motion, do **not** use checkerboards, alternating-pixel sheets, or visible grids as the start image background.

Those guides work for still-image spritesheet generation, but video models often interpret them as floors, rooms, horizons, or perspective grids. This causes camera drift, character turning, and scene motion instead of a clean in-place walk.

For walk-cycle video passes, create a direction-specific neutral plate:
- `1280x720` canvas
- flat neutral gray background
- one approved direction anchor centered with feet visible
- no checker/grid/floor/horizon/arrows/labels
- enough padding for bobbing and cloth sway

Prompt the video model to lock:
- facing direction
- camera and framing
- flat background
- in-place walk motion
- no scene, no props, no effects

Use the image-to-video walk-cycle template in `references/prompt-patterns.md`.

Treat the video as motion reference first. Extract raw frames, build contact sheets and GIFs, and let the team curate frames before runtime export.

For video-derived walk/run cycles, prefer a conservative first export that preserves the full selected video canvas and scales that whole canvas into the runtime cell. Do not immediately crop every frame to the visible foreground unless the user explicitly wants a compact foreground-fit pass. Full-canvas preservation keeps camera framing, apparent scale, and small stride motion closer to the source video; foreground fitting can be useful later, but it may introduce height changes, x/y jitter, and per-frame zoom.

If pixel snapping is used for video frames, run it before runtime layout while frames are still full selected video frames. Treat it as optional: on AI video outputs it can discover different native grids per frame and make motion less stable.

### 3. Prompt for the whole sheet

Structure the prompt like a production brief:
- intended use
- image roles
- subject and direction
- ordered frame sequence
- look/rendering constraints
- composition constraints
- explicit avoid list

Keep the frame list concrete. For example:
- `Frame 1: ready idle`
- `Frame 5: first shot muzzle flash`
- `Frame 10: return to idle`

Use the prompt patterns in `references/prompt-patterns.md`.

### 4. Do not trust naive cell crops blindly

Even when the output size is exactly correct, the model may let hats, coats, feet, or muzzle flashes spill outside the implied cell boundaries.

Use `scripts/recover_component_frames.py` on the **full sheet** first:
- detect the dominant foreground components
- bucket them back onto the intended grid
- save tight recovered frame crops

This is often the real source of truth.

### 5. Remove background after silhouette recovery

If you need cleaner edges, run background removal on the recovered component crops, not on the original rigid cell crops.

Use `scripts/remove_bg_batch.py` for remove.bg.

Why:
- raw cell crops may already be wrong
- whole-sheet background removal often destroys the original geometry
- per-component removal preserves the recovered silhouette

### 6. Normalize every frame to one shared anchor

For recovered image-sheet crops, use `scripts/normalize_frames.py` to place every recovered/cleaned crop onto a fixed runtime frame, such as:
- canvas `256x256`
- center `x = 128`
- bottom `y = 255`

This is what prevents sideways drift and fake “skating” for generated sheet crops. For video-derived frames, first consider preserving the source video canvas into the runtime cell; normalize foreground crops only as a deliberate second pass when the preserved-canvas character is too small or needs a compact engine-facing frame.

If the generated cells are **opaque flat-background crops** rather than transparent crops, do not build GIFs directly from those cells. First use `scripts/normalize_flat_bg_frames.py` to flood-fill the connected corner background, crop the actual foreground, and normalize every frame to the same center/bottom anchor. This fixes the common idle-sheet failure where the model places the character at different x/y offsets inside each nominal `256x256` cell.

### 6b. Audit the visible foot baseline before runtime export

After normalization, verify the **visible** alpha bounds inside the final engine frames.

This is separate from the image canvas size. A frame can be `256x256` and still be wrong if the feet end at `y = 215` with 40px of transparent padding underneath. In engines like Phaser, the sprite origin and shadow are usually applied to the full frame rectangle, not the visible pixels, so inconsistent bottom padding makes characters look like they float above their shadow.

Before exporting runtime sheets:
- inspect the alpha bounding box for every frame
- ensure the lowest non-transparent pixel lands on the intended baseline, commonly `bottomY = 255` for `256x256`
- compare all directions for the same character, not just frames within one animation
- if a review canvas is larger than runtime, rebaseline after downscaling or crop/pad into the runtime frame deliberately

If using the `gamedev-assets` skill, run `asset_sprite_baseline.py` to audit and optionally write baseline-corrected sheets.

### 6c. Prove runtime variants and mirrors before adding variety

When an engine animation appears to move even though the DOM/canvas object stays fixed, suspect the sheet registration before changing game coordinates.

Use this isolation loop:
- first ship a single source strip with one frame size, one frame count, and one shared anchor
- verify the runtime sampler uses the real column count, for example `384x64` means `6` frames of `64x64`
- for CSS sprites, use exact background positions for the columns; a 6-frame strip is `0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%`
- remove mirrored rendering such as `scaleX(-1)` until the non-mirrored strip is stable
- only reintroduce alternate sheets or mirrored variants after comparing alpha bounds, visible center, and baseline against the primary strip frame by frame

If a bug disappears when two alternated sheets become one strip, the runtime placement was probably fine. The variants had different visual anchors inside their cells.

### 6d. Prove runtime playback before blaming the sheet

When a sprite stays on frame `0`, stops halfway through an action, or only plays part of death/attack at higher game speeds, audit the runtime before rebuilding assets.

Use this checklist:
- keep the rendered sprite node stable for the whole animation; do not recreate or reparent it every tick
- if z-order sorting is needed, compare the current id order and only move DOM nodes when the order actually changes
- for CSS `background-position` sprites, use discrete frame timing such as `steps(1, end)` with explicit frame keyframes; do not rely on smooth `linear` interpolation between sheet columns
- make the CSS animation duration match the simulation state timer for the action, for example attack state `840ms` should use an `840ms` animation at x1
- if the simulation has a speed multiplier such as x2 or x4, scale CSS sprite durations with the same inverse multiplier, for example `calc(840ms * var(--time-scale, 1))`
- update that time-scale variable when the speed button changes, not only on initial render
- verify with `getAnimations()` or sampled `background-position` at two timestamps before editing the sheet

If x1 looks correct but x2 stops at half and x4 stops at a quarter, the sheet is probably fine. The runtime timer is scaled while the CSS animation duration is not.

### 7. Build review artifacts

Use:
- `scripts/build_contact_sheet.py` for labeled review sheets
- `scripts/build_sequence_gif.py` for full loops or curated sequences

Review at least:
- the generated sheet
- the recovered frame crops
- the normalized contact sheet
- the selected-sequence GIF

### 7b. Always show the sheets in chat

Whenever this skill is used and any sheet or animation frames are available, automatically show a contact-sheet preview in the final response. Do not wait for the user to ask.

The preview should be like a production review board:
- crop the relevant animation row or selected frames
- arrange frames in a readable grid instead of one huge strip when there are many frames
- upscale with nearest-neighbor so the pixels are inspectable
- label frames with simple numbers such as `frame 1`, `frame 2`, etc.
- use a neutral dark background and enough spacing between cells
- include the selected-sequence GIF too when it exists

If a spritesheet has multiple animations, show each relevant action sheet separately. If the user asks about one action, show only that action's frames.

When scripts do not already produce a contact sheet in this format, create one from the runtime frames or sheet cells before replying. A local temporary PNG is fine for quick review, but durable work should save the contact sheet next to the run artifacts.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

❌ **Anti-pattern: trusting the invisible grid**
Why bad: the model may compose across cells even when the canvas size is exact.
Better: recover components from the full sheet before committing to frame boundaries.

❌ **Anti-pattern: background removal on the whole sheet**
Why bad: tools like remove.bg often crop to overall foreground bounds and destroy sheet geometry.
Better: remove backgrounds per recovered component crop.

❌ **Anti-pattern: per-frame recentering from scratch**
Why bad: it introduces drift and fake motion.
Better: normalize all frames to one shared center and bottom anchor.

❌ **Anti-pattern: treating frame size as proof of foot alignment**
Why bad: a `256x256` sheet can still contain 40px of transparent padding below the feet, causing shadow/origin bugs in-engine.
Better: audit alpha bounds and normalize the visible foot baseline before runtime export.

❌ **Anti-pattern: using checker/grid backgrounds for image-to-video walk cycles**
Why bad: video models interpret them as physical scenes and add perspective, horizons, camera drift, or character turns.
Better: use a neutral `1280x720` flat-background direction plate, then curate and normalize selected frames after extraction.

❌ **Anti-pattern: polishing before recovery**
Why bad: edge cleanup cannot restore missing feet or sliced coats.
Better: recover the full silhouette first, then clean the edges.

❌ **Anti-pattern: assuming “pixel perfect” tools always help**
Why bad: some pixel-snapping tools over-quantize and shrink high-resolution pixelated sprites.
Better: for generated sheets, test them only after recovery and normalization; for video-derived frames, test them on full selected frames before layout. In both cases, keep them only if readability and motion stability improve.

❌ **Anti-pattern: foreground-fitting video frames by default**
Why bad: a video already carries camera framing and scale. Cropping each frame to its foreground bbox and re-grounding it can add jitter, height changes, and fake zoom.
Better: for video-derived walk/run cycles, first export a preserve-canvas pass, then try foreground-fit only if the sprite is too small or the runtime target requires a compact crop.

❌ **Anti-pattern: adding alternate sheets or mirrors before registration is proven**
Why bad: two sheets can both be `64x64` per frame and still have different visible centers. Mirroring can make that mismatch look like a runtime position bug.
Better: make one single-source strip stable in-engine first, then add variants only if their alpha bounds, center, and baseline match the original frame by frame.

❌ **Anti-pattern: reparenting or rebuilding animated sprite nodes every tick**
Why bad: CSS animations can restart when the DOM node is moved or recreated. At 60 FPS this can look like every monster is frozen on frame `0`.
Better: keep one stable node per runtime sprite. Only reorder nodes when the layer order really changes, and patch style/classes in place.

❌ **Anti-pattern: using smooth timing for sheet columns**
Why bad: `linear` interpolation between `background-position` columns can land between frames or behave inconsistently across browsers.
Better: use explicit frame ranges plus `steps(1, end)` for CSS spritesheets unless you intentionally want sub-frame interpolation.

❌ **Anti-pattern: ignoring game speed in CSS animation durations**
Why bad: the simulation may remove an attack/death state after scaled time, while the CSS animation still expects x1 real time. x2 cuts at half, x4 cuts at a quarter.
Better: expose a runtime time-scale variable and apply it to sprite animation durations, for example `animation: attack calc(840ms * var(--time-scale, 1)) steps(1, end) both`.

## Variation Guidance

**IMPORTANT**: Do not force every spritesheet into the same aesthetic.

Vary the pipeline based on:
- target look: strict retro pixel art vs high-resolution pixelated art
- direction set: south-only, west/east, north, 4-direction, 8-direction
- action type: walk, idle, attack, hurt, death
- sheet layout: single frame, strip, `2x5`, `4x4`, etc.

Things that should remain stable inside a sequence:
- identity source
- shared anchor rule
- frame canvas size
- visible foot baseline inside the final runtime frame
- runtime variant anchors, when multiple sheets or mirrors are used for the same action
- runtime node identity during an animation
- timing parity between animation duration, action-state timer, and game speed multiplier
- selection logic for the final GIF

Things that may vary:
- prompt wording by action and direction
- selected frame order
- palette cleanup strategy
- whether background removal is needed at all

## Adaptation Rules

Use the workflow as a toolkit, not a rigid ceremony.

- If the model already gives isolated clean frames, skip recovery and go straight to normalization.
- If the sheet geometry is unreliable, trust full-sheet recovery over nominal cell math.
- If background removal damages important edges, keep the opaque crop and normalize that instead.
- If the output is a single directional anchor, stop after generation and review unless the user explicitly wants a sheet.
- If a one-shot runner is overkill, call the individual scripts directly and keep the artifacts that matter.
- If normalized review frames are downscaled or converted into runtime sheets, audit the final runtime PNGs again; review anchors do not automatically survive resizing.
- If runtime drift only appears with alternate sheets or mirrored variants, collapse to one source strip and prove that stable before reintroducing variety.
- If a runtime sprite freezes on frame `0`, first check whether the engine is recreating/reparenting the node every tick.
- If an action animation is cut short only at x2/x4, first scale the CSS duration with the simulation speed multiplier.

## Quick Start

Use the runner when the user wants the whole pipeline, not just one script:

```bash
uv run scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --work-dir runs/my-character-attack \
  --reference refs/character-anchor-1024.png \
  --guide refs/alternating-sheet-512x1280.png \
  --prompt-file prompts/attack-sheet.txt \
  --sheet-size 512x1280 \
  --sheet-prefix attack-sheet \
  --rows 5 \
  --cols 2 \
  --frame-canvas 256x256 \
  --center-x 128 \
  --bottom-y 255 \
  --remove-bg \
  --selected-order 01,03,02,04,05,07,09 \
  --durations-ms 140,110,110,110,120,120,160 \
  --flat-bg '#f0f0f0'
```

The runner defaults to the sibling `gpt-image-2-0` skill for generation. Override with `--gpt-image-edit-script` or `ANIMATED_SPRITESHEETS_GPT_IMAGE_EDIT` if your installation layout differs.

## Remember

The hard part of AI spritesheets is rarely “make the model draw a character”.

The hard part is getting from a promising sheet to stable, readable, engine-style frames.

Recover the silhouette first. Clean the edges second. Normalize third. Curate the motion last.

Always show the user the resulting sheets/frames as contact-sheet previews in chat. A spritesheet task is not finished until the user can visually inspect the frames without opening files manually.

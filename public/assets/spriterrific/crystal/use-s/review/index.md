# use-s Review

Quick review page for the `s` facing `use` animation. Mode: `image`. Frames: `8`. FPS: `8`.

## Review Assets

### Generated Sheet

Full opaque pose board produced by the image model. Image size: `1536x1152`. Expected generation canvas: `1536x1152`.

### Rough Grid Review Crops

First `8` implied grid cells cropped from the pose board for review only. These are not the runtime source of truth. Generation grid: `4x3`. Cell size: `384x384`. Review image size: `1352x204`.

### Rough Grid Review GIF

Implied grid crops looped for geometry review only. GIF canvas: `256x256`.

### Recovered Component Contact Sheet

Foreground components recovered from the full pose board and ordered by the declared grid. These recovered components are the runtime source. Review image size: `947x204`.

### Recovered Native Contact Sheet

Recovered components placed on a shared padded native review canvas without scaling. This is the first animation review checkpoint before pixel snap or 256x256 runtime normalization. Review image size: `1168x204`.

### Recovered Native Preview GIF

Recovered components looped on the padded native review canvas before runtime normalization. GIF canvas: `384x448`.

### Pixel-Snapped Raw Contact Sheet

Raw real pixel-snapper outputs shown without padding; labels show discovered native frame sizes. This is diagnostic output, not runtime-ready. In chroma-layout runs the input canvas uses the run's configured chroma matte, but pixel snapper may remap the flat background to another solid color such as black during palette/resampling. Review image size: `1334x428`.

### Pixel Snap To Runtime Comparison

Single frame-by-frame comparison from source to runtime. For chroma-layout, read the rows as: recovered transparent component, chroma source canvas, raw pixel-snap output, background-cleaned snapped output, optional green-fringe-cleaned output when the matte is green, then final normalized transparent `256x256` runtime frame. Review image size: `2310x950`.
